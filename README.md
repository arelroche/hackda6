# What is it?
Pick'emup GO is an application to help people organize for pickup sports (or other ad hoc events).
Imagine yourself wanting to play a good game of basketball. You have a court available, but you wanna play in full teams. You only have two friends ready to play, so how do you fill the remaining seven spots? The app allows you (the host) to pin a location, set an event type and duration and publish it to the community. Then other would be players when they're searching for things to do, can see what's happening near them and commit to events.

# Where can I use it?
It can be found in its current iteration on https://pickemupgo.herokuapp.com/

# How to use the app?
1. Create event in the Create Event page
   * You'll need to a Event Name, a Host, a date, start/end times, Group Size, and few other optional fields
   * There are also some optional fields to fill out more details
2. Search Page you set your current location, and then set a search radius in miles
3. The Search Results then show you all the activities happening near you

# Future Improvements

* Add a "number of people committed" tracker to the event
* Add a notification system so people can subscribe to event types. (Basketball, Baseball, Hockey, etc.)
* Improve general UX
* remove mlab credentials...
